# bubbleSort
A program built in python that sorts integers in a list using the bubble sort method

Upcoming Updates/Code Refactoring:
- Add an additional check where if the list is already in order, then return a Boolean that set to true if a swap has been made
- One count instead of two and compare list[num] to list[num+1]
